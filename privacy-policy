## 4.  COOKIES & TRACKING

The App itself does not use browser cookies, but third-party SDKs (Firebase, AdMob) set mobile identifiers or similar tracking technologies for analytics and advertising. You can reset or limit these identifiers in your device settings.

---

## 5.  DATA RETENTION

We keep personal data only as long as necessary:

* **Account & design data** – until you delete it in-app or request deletion.
* **Analytics & crash logs** – 24 months (default Firebase retention) then aggregated or deleted.
* **Legal records** – as long as laws require (e.g., tax invoices up to 7 years).

When data is no longer needed we delete or anonymise it.

---

## 6.  CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

Ambigram is **not directed to children under 13**.  We do not knowingly collect data from minors.  If you believe we have done so inadvertently, please contact us and we will delete it.

## 7.  YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS

Depending on your location, you can:

* Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
* Ask us to correct, delete or restrict processing of your data.
* Object to certain processing (e.g., direct marketing).
* Withdraw consent at any time (this won’t affect prior lawful processing).

To exercise any right, e-mail **[privacy@ambigram.app](mailto:privacy@ambigram.app)** or use the in-app “Privacy & Data” form.  We will respond within 30 days (or the timeframe required by law).

## 8.  DO-NOT-TRACK

Because there is no uniform industry DNT standard, we currently do not respond to DNT signals.

## 9.  CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
